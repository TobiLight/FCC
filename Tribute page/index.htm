            <strong class="early">Early Career</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Born 15th October 1938 as Olufela Olusegun Oludotun Ransome-Kuti</li>
                <li>Attended the primary and secondary school Nigeria and was later sent to London in 1958 to study medicine but decided to study music instead - the trumpet was his preferred instrument</li>
            </ul>
            <!-- Fela's Career -->
            <strong class="career">Career</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>In 1967, he went to Ghana to think up a new musical direction. That was when Kuti first called his sound "Afrobeat".</li>
                <li>In 1969, Fela took his band to the United States where they spent 10 months in Los Angeles. During his US travels, Fela discovered the Black Power movement through Sandra Smith (now Sandra Izsadore), a partisan of the Black Panther Party.
                    The experience would heavily influence his music and political outlook.</li>
                <li>After Fela and his band returned to Nigeria, the group was renamed The Afrika '70, as lyrical themes changed from love to social issues.</li>
                <li>Fela made the decision to sing in "Pidgin English" so that his music could be enjoyed by people all over Africa.</li>
                <li>In 1977, Fela and the Afrika '70 released the album "Zombie" a scorching attack on Nigerian soldiers using the zombie metaphor to describe the methods of the Nigerian military.</li>
                <li>The album was a smash hit and infuriated the government, setting off a vicious attack against the Kalakuta Republic (Fela's private commune) during which one thousand soldiers attacked the commune.</li>
                <li>Fela was severely beaten, and his elderly mother (whose house was located opposite the commune) was thrown from a window, causing fatal injuries. The Kalakuta Republic was burned, and Fela's studio, instruments, and master recordings were
                    destroyed.
                </li>
                <li>Fela claimed that he would have been killed had it not been for the intervention of a commanding officer as he was being beaten.</li>
                <li>In 1978, Fela married 27 women, many of whom were his dancers, composers, and singers to mark the anniversary of the attack on the Kalakuta Republic.</li>
                <li>In 1979, for Fela was marked by two notorious concerts, the first in Ghana where riots broke out during the song "Zombie", which led to Fela being banned from entering Ghana.</li>
                <li>The second was at the Berlin Jazz Festival after which most of Fela's musicians deserted him, due to rumours that Fela was planning to use the entire proceeds to fund his presidential campaign.</li>
                <li>Despite the massive setbacks, Fela was determined to come back. He formed his own political party, which he called Movement of the People (MOP), in order to "clean up society like a mop". Later on in 1979, he put himself forward for President
                    in Nigeria's first elections for more than a decade, but his candidature was refused.</li>
                <li>At this time, Fela created a new band called Egypt '80 and continued to record albums and tour made a number of successful tours of the United States and Europe and also continued to be politically active.</li>
            </ul>
            <!-- Fela's impact -->
            <strong class="impact">Impact</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>The musical style of Fel√° is called Afrobeat, a style he largely created, which is a complex fusion of jazz, funk, Ghanaian/Nigerian highlife, psychedelic rock and traditional West African chants and rhythms.</li>
                <li>Fela Kuti still influences artists around the world to this very day, inspiring the next generation to stand up for common people and fight for justice everywhere.</li>
                <li>A riff-based "endless groove" is used, in which a base rhythm of drums, shekere, muted West African-style guitar and melodic bass guitar riffs are repeated throughout the song.</li>
            </ul>
